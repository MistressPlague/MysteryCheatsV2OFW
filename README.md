# Open-Development Of Mystery Cheats V2 For OFW
This is a community-driven project, intended on being developed by everyone willing. I will not finish it prematurely if unfinished. I want many to have their place in helping.

It is suggested to use Poppy's FF Editor for working on this easier.
Fork the repo, do your edits, do a pull request.
